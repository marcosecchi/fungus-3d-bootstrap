## Prerequisites

For these lessons you will need [Unity3D](https://store.unity.com/?_ga=2.175184613.639057983.1511186465-253114653.1489499620) installed on your computer.

During the lessons I'll use [Fungus](http://fungusgames.com/), an open-source plugin for Unity3D. My advice is [to follow the video tutorials](http://fungusdocs.snozbot.com/tutorial_videos.html): they are not mandatory, but you will find them very helpful for a basic knowledge of the tool.

> The Unity version used for the tutorial is **2017.1.1f1**, while the Fungus version is **3.7** (the axeples are not compatible with previous versione of Fungus).
